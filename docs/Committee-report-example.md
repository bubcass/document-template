## Cathaoirleach’s Foreword

Safeguarding is everybody’s responsibility.

However, there is a profound failure of empathy, understanding and compassion with regard the lack of urgency in ensuring development of comprehensive policy, regulation, and legislation to protect people with disabilities.

This report focusses on two public meetings undertaken by the Committee; 31 March 2022 HIQA, Sage Advocacy, the Irish Association of Social Workers and Professor Brendan Kelly, professor of psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin attended.
Safeguarding Ireland attended a public meeting on 21 February 2024. Several key findings and recommendations arose from the meetings.

Key stakeholders who have responsibility for safeguarding, as well academics, presented alarming evidence to the Committee regarding the prevalence of abuse and safeguarding issues, and lack of appropriate management. It is alarming to hear of the extent of under reporting, and that we are only seeing the ‘tip of the iceberg’ with regard the cases reported.

Abuse can include sexual and physical assaults, and financial abuse, however, abuse also includes when someone is being left for a long time, the bell is not being responded to and his or her needs are not being met, or instead of getting a 20-minute walk in the garden because he or she needs to use the commode, the person will miss out on a walk that day.

As well as urgent enactment of appropriate adult safeguarding legislation, the Committee call for the immediate establishment of a working group to consider the system required when the legislation is enacted. We must be ready to meet the legislation when it is enacted.

I would like to thank all the stakeholders who attended meetings and those who made submissions to the Committee for their valuable engagement. Thank you to Committee Members for all their hard work. I also wish to acknowledge the assistance of the Committee support team in preparing this report.

## Recommendations

### Governance and data collection

1. The Department of Health must eliminate the practice of placing older and/or
    disabled people in large group settings and ensure that all providers of
    residential and day settings have measures in place to prioritise the
    protection of individuals and investigation of all allegations.
2. The Department of Health must ensure the voice of people with disabilities in
    safeguarding policy and practice through research and meaningful
    participation structures.
3. The Department of Health must develop a comprehensive and inclusive
    national rights-based safeguarding policy and regulatory infrastructure to
    ensure appropriate resourcing, monitoring, and implementation of standards
    across all services. Appropriate definitions to support monitoring within a
    rights-based model of safeguarding are also required, including:
       
    a) developing a zero-tolerance approach to adult abuse across all
          settings and supporting a cultural change

    b) ensuring that every public or private body put a safeguarding policy
          in place, as well as ensuring all relevant sectors have appropriate
          data collection policies.

    c) that any process to safeguard a person’s liberty should apply to all
          people equally and where a person’s liberty is being restricted,
          they should have access to an independent advocate to ensure
          their will and preference.

4. The Department of Health must establish a National Adult Safeguarding
    Authority, led by the Department of Justice with the involvement of the
    Departments of Health, Social Protection, Housing, Finance and Children,
    Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. In addition, participation by key statutory agencies such as the National Safeguarding Office, Decision
Support Service, HSE Health and Social Care Services, Mental Health
Commission, Citizens Information Board, Courts Service, Data Protection
Commissioner, Central Bank, Financial Services Regulator and An Garda
Síochána is essential.

5. The Department of Health must ensure national collection of data across all
    sectors, which incorporates a framework and statutory bases for inter-agency
    co-operation, collaboration, and data sharing. Detailed safeguarding activity
    by HIQA, An Garda Síochána, Safeguarding and Protection Teams and service
    providers to inform service responses must be published as well as full,
    transparent, and accessible safeguarding adult reviews.
6. The Department of Health must develop systematic co-working between
    mental health services, primary care, and social care in line with good data
    protection practice and introduce Individual Health Identifier numbers to
    connect services.
7. In the interim, the Department of Health must set up of a working group to
    scope out legislative provisions and consider the composition of the national
    safeguarding authority on foot of the Law Reform Commission’s report to
    ensure the State is ready to meet the legislation when it is enacted. All
    relevant stakeholders including IASW and Safeguarding Ireland, as well as
    direct consultation with persons lived experience must be included.

### Awareness raising and human dignity.

8. The Department of Health must ensure comprehensive training for all staff
    across all government departments and agencies providing services to adults
    who may be at risk of harm or abuse. The private sector and the providers of essential services such as financial services and utilities must also be
included.
9. The Department of Health must ensure increased safeguarding measures and
    run a national information campaign advising how people can access
    Safeguarding and Protection Services, including residents and their families.
10. In the instance of safeguarding abuse, the Department of Health must
    ensure that families are fully and formally informed of risks in their own
    environment at the same time as the service provider.

### Eliminating financial abuse

11. Under their role to set up a new regulatory regime for online safety,
    Coimisiún na Meán, must ensure digital services are designed in order that
    people with disabilities can use them safely.

### Effective safeguarding service

12. The Department of Health must ensure resourcing to support limitations on
    the role of HSE safeguarding personnel.
13. The Department of Justice and An Garda Síochána must introduce specific
    safeguarding police officers.
14. The Department of Health must introduce specialised teams, staffed with
    appropriate professionals, such as social workers, speech and language
    therapists, psychologists, occupational therapists, counsellors, and social
    care staff, to provide person-centred support in the aftermath of abuse to
    ensure that people with disabilities, who may have communication
    difficulties, can tell their story of abuse, at their own pace and in their own
    way and with the right supports.

15. In the interim the Department of Health must:

    a) ensure a single point of contact for any adult who is at risk or has
       experience of abuse including access to Legal Aid or
       representation.

    b) immediately establish a national 24-hour dedicated support line for
       adult safeguarding with the capacity to initiate an effective and
       appropriate response.

    c) undertake a public campaign to highlight the existing service and
       that safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility.

### Legislative provision

16. The Department of Health must ensure urgent enactment of safeguarding
    legislation based on appropriate principles, including the UNCRPD to ensure
    that instances of exploitation, violence, and abuse against persons with
    disabilities are identified, investigated and, where appropriate, prosecuted.
17. The Department of Health must immediately:

    a) Consider establishing social work as the relevant expert profession
       with responsibility and accountability for safeguarding decisions
       and processes, with appropriate governance structures and
       operational autonomy with final decision-making resting with an
       accountable, registered Chief Social Worker appointed in the HSE.

    b) Increase HIQA regulatory powers, to include inspection of social
       work safeguarding activity.

    c) Address organisational cultural barriers which prevent staff
       speaking up.

    d) Consider that all relevant HSE job descriptions must refer to the requirement to demonstrate competency in adult safeguarding, including reporting procedures.

    e) Ensure that all agencies with a safeguarding remit must resource
social workers/Designated Officers to carry out their work.
    
    f) In conjunction with the Department of Justice, include groups at
higher risk of abuse, including adults with disabilities, in the new
national gender-based violence strategy.
    
    g) Resource Safeguarding and Protection social workers and A Garda
Síochána to carry out investigations with adults with disabilities
when abuse is reported.

    h) Ensure access to specialist expertise (therapeutic services) to
assist both the person with a disability and the investigation teams,
in the aftermath of a report of abuse.

    i) Consider placing public health visiting guidance on a statutory
footing with consequences for service providers who introduce
excessive visiting restrictions.

18.  Government to expedite statutory home care legislation.
19.  Social care legislation promoting the well-being of individuals, requires
    organisations both public and private to have systems in place to promote
    well-being, to prevent and reduce abuse and advise individuals as to where
    they can get assistance.
20.  Immediate enactment of Deprivation of Liberty legislation and consultation
    with people with disabilities and families.


21. Ensure resourcing so that people with mild intellectual disability and mental
    health problems have a dedicated service, similar to if they had moderate
    intellectual disability.
22. Ensure the publishing of the report of the Law Reform Commission on a
    legislative framework for adult safeguarding during 2024.


## Summary of findings

### Significant prevalence and underreporting of abuse in Ireland.

1. The prevalence of safeguarding issues and failures in the management of
    these safeguarding concerns is impacting Irelands progress in adhering to
    the principles set out in Articles 16 and 19 of the UNCRPD. Abuse and neglect
    of vulnerable adults is significantly underreported in Ireland.
2. In 2022, Safeguarding Ireland published the most comprehensive overview
    and analysis of adult Safeguarding issues in Ireland to date in a discussion
    paper called _Identifying RISKS Sharing RESPONSIBILITIES The Case for a_
    _Comprehensive Approach to Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults_ , describing the
    nature of adult abuse in Ireland, the patchwork of legislation that exists to
    protect people and the deficits in terms of what is known about adult
    safeguarding. The current policy and legislative response and the absence of
    an overarching governing body creates a gap in accountability, collaboration,
    and coherence across all sectors.
3. Despite growing awareness, a culture that is dismissive of certain forms of
    abuse, which trivialises other forms of abuse and that plays down the human
    rights of many adults in vulnerable circumstances persists in Ireland.
    Significant cultural change is required.
4. There are many gaps which have led to significant breaches of human rights
    for people with disabilities and elderly people in residential settings, both
    State and in private settings. These include adult safeguarding legislation,
    social care legislation, and the absence of a uniform regulatory framework
    covering legislation, policies, accountability, and enforcement across all
    settings. Others include legislation on deprivation of liberty to include a place
    of care; regulation of home care services; legislative underpinning for the
    practice of independent advocacy in Ireland; multidisciplinary and cross-
    sectoral policy on self-neglect; guidance and regulation on data sharing; a
comprehensive cross-sectoral framework for data collection on abuse of
adults; and departmental and agency policy and related accountability
procedures and training for staff outside of health and social care sectors,
which applies to all Departments and agencies providing services to adults
who may be at risk of harm or abuse.
5. The requirement for policy also extends to the private sector and, to the
    providers of essential services such as financial services and utilities. Also
    necessary is the need for the recognition and criminalisation of coercive
    control in non-intimate partner relationships; access to legal aid and-or
    representation; and a single point of contact for any adult who is at risk or
    who has experience of abuse.

6. It is in scenarios and cultures where rights are overlooked, well-being is
    ignored and a person lacks choice and autonomy in his or her own life, that
    abuse is most likely to occur.
7. Abuse in Ireland includes the more significant instances of abuse, including
    sexual and physical assaults, and financial abuse where social welfare
    payments abused by a third party. However, abuse also includes when
    someone is being left for a long time, the bell is not being responded to and
    his or her needs are not being met. Abuse is when, instead of getting a 20-
    minute walk in the garden because he or she needs to use the commode, the
    person will miss a walk that day. Abuse is when people’s money is being used
    to pay for things that have nothing to do with themselves, or units where milk
    and sugar are still added to pots of tea because that is the way one person
    likes it and it does not matter that someone else does not, so that is the way
    he or she is getting it.
8. Peer abuse is often minimised, ignoring the fact that it is akin to experiences
    of domestic violence for a resident in a care setting.

9. Nursing assistants can be fearful to report up the line, which sustains the lack
    of reporting. Many people who are the victims of abuse or lack of
    safeguarding are also afraid because they may be dependent on other
    people. It is everyone’s responsibility to recognise and raise awareness about
    any form of abuse.

### Significant concern with regard financial abuse

10. Financial abuse is very prevalent in Ireland as reported by the HSE. Coercive
    control, controlling behaviour for financial, sexual, or physical abuse,
    permeates all other types of abuse.
11. Safeguarding Ireland undertook a survey which asked the question, “Does
    another person have a right to make decisions on behalf of a person who is
    old and frail without their consent?” Some 57% of the Irish population think
    you can do so without the consent of the person, even if they have capacity.
    Decisions are made on behalf of people, particularly people in vulnerable
    circumstances or people with disability. There is a greater lack of respect for
    their rights. For example, families think they can just manage the money or
    decide. They think they can pick up the pension or disability benefit and it is
    family money, not that individuals’ money.
12. People with disabilities can be put under significant pressure from family to
    sell a house they have inherited and distribute the money among the family
    and may end up homeless. Before the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity
    Act, there was no oversight of attorneys, and there were cases of financial
    abuse including attorneys not paying for care or collecting the pension of the
    person concerned but also selling a person’s property. Under the Assisted
    Decision-Making Capacity Act if a court order is made to appoint somebody to
    deal with somebody’s property, it must be used for the benefit of that person
    and the Decision Support Service has a specific function of oversight in
    relation to any of the decision’s supporters who are appointed under the Act.

13. The Department of Social Protection pays out in the order of €25 billion
    annually in pensions, disability payments and so on, however the percentage
    of financial abuse is estimated between 12% and 20%. The Department has
    a vulnerable customers section that will respond to complaints made, but it
    does not share that information with other organisations that may also need
    the information. There is no reason under the current legislation, either GDPR
    or the 2018 Act, why the information is not shared, but it is not done because
    there are no protocols regarding the necessity to do it.
14. The Committee’s public meeting – 10 March 2022 ‘Enabling financial
    independence for disabled women’ highlighted the difficulties gaining
    financial independence for women with disabilities considering the effect of
    double discrimination and because financial independence can be challenged
    due to cognitive, physical, or sensory disability, an acquired brain injury,
    mental health difficulties, an inability to communicate effectively, lack of
    family and community supports, or an inability to access financial services
    that meet their needs.
15. As noted by Sage Advocacy, where there are challenges to financial
    independence, there is a need for robust systems in place for the monitoring
    and management of an individual finances when they are, due to their
    disability, a resident in a hospital, nursing home or residential setting. If
    robust systems are not in place financial exploitation can take place. This
    financial exploitation can go beyond personal finances and often include the
    illegal or improper use of property, the misuse of an adult’s home, theft of
    possessions, inappropriate use of resources such as utilities, food, and
    transfer of resources such as property and assets and coercion and
    intimidation to gain access to assets including gift giving and creating a will.


### Lack of monitoring of safeguarding concerns

16. Adult safeguarding reviews are rarely published in full in Ireland and are
    ‘owned’ by the HSE/Service Provider who are then the gatekeeper of
    information about failures in their own services. Residents and families are
    uninformed about the true extent of failings within their ‘home’.
17. A culture of underreporting can prevail in a public domain where language is
    minimised, for example, ‘rough handling’ is used instead of physical abuse,
    ‘inappropriate use of resident finances’, instead of financial abuse, ‘poor
    quality care’, is used instead of neglect.
18. Research by the Department of Health shows that people do not know how
    or where to report abuse.
19. Ireland does not collate adequate data about the abuse of adults with
    disabilities, this impacts negatively on service planning**.**
20. While 51,000 concerns about the abuse and neglect of adults have been
    reported to the HSE Safeguarding and Protection Social Work teams since
    2015, it is unknown how many relate to people with disabilities. 143 sexual
    assaults against residents of care settings were reported to HIQA from 2015
    to 2022; 87 of these assaults were in nursing homes where many people with
    disabilities reside and 56 cases in disability centres. However, this data is
    limited to the health and social care services and does not extend to other
    HSE facilities.
21. In 2019, Safeguarding Ireland carried out a poll of a representative sample
    of adults asking them about their experience, or an experience they had
    witnessed, of adult abuse. Some 10% of adults said that they had either
    experienced or witnessed adult abuse. This adds up to approximately
    400,000 cases. The HSE Safeguarding Office Annual Report 2023 has more
    than 13,000 reported cases of suspected adult abuse. This demonstrates a  significant gap between what is reported to the HSE services and what may
be the reality.
 
22. The figures from the HSE indicate that almost 80% of the main perpetrators
    of financial abuse are relatives and family members. A risk of financial abuse
    is most definitely created where people find it difficult to engage with
    services, financial services in particular, and do not have the assistance of a
    third party.
23. An Garda Síochána cannot provide figures about the rates of abuse and
    neglect of residents in nursing homes or disability centres reported to them.
24. In the absence of primary safeguarding legislation, guidance and information
    is required to ensure personal sensitive information and data can be shared
    securely for the purposes of safeguarding a person. The interpretation of
    GDPR and lack of statutory bases for interagency work and information
    sharing, severely restricts safeguarding practice. Therefore, a hospital social
    worker who is asked to review an adult with a disability admitted with signs of
    serious neglect from a nursing home or disability centre, cannot then identify
    that individual to HIQA for follow up, but can only express general concerns
    about care standards in that centre/residence.
25. People with disabilities are often regarded as ‘unreliable witnesses.’ The new
    Garda National Protective Services Unit does not highlight that people with
    disabilities are within their remit and expertise. This may mean that those
    who are most at risk of abuse are less able to protect themselves, less able to
    report the abuse and have less access to justice and reparation processes.

### Failures in governance

26. Unlike Tusla, there is no ‘one stop shop’ to report adult abuse. Residents and
    Families are ‘bounced’ between services, contacting Safeguarding and
    Protection Social Work teams (who do not have a remit in private services),
    HIQA (who do not investigate individual complaints), the Ombudsman (who does not investigate clinical complaints), the Office of the Confidential
Recipient (who can only accept concerns in relation to HSE services) and An
Garda Síochána. The needs of the person with disability are easily lost.

27.  The Garda Síochána process highlight that where an individual lacks capacity
    and the Gardai do not interview, even though the individual may have very
    clear evidence of financial abuse. There is a need to raise awareness to
    ensure that An Garda Síochána follow up on their obligation in line with the
    Assisted Decision-Making Capacity, even though it may not lead to a
    prosecution.
28.  HIQA regulates designated centres and nursing homes but has no remit in
    terms of dealing with individual safeguarding issues.
29.  In comparison to child protection, social work has less influence in adult
    safeguarding practice and policy development. Operational social work
    governance and expertise, drawing on human rights lens and approach to
    practice, is absent at senior HSE management level which in turn has
    significant implications for how the HSE understands and responds to adult
    safeguarding throughout the country. This has a direct impact on people with
    disabilities living in residential care settings.
30.  The HSE published adult safeguarding policy, Safeguarding Vulnerable
    Persons at Risk of Abuse - Policy and Procedures (2014) and CHO
    Safeguarding Operations are part of a wide range of measures to protect the
    welfare and safety of adults who may be vulnerable and at risk of abuse.
    However, the policy excluded adults using services such as mental health
    services and private nursing homes.
31.  In 2019 a new HSE draft adult safeguarding policy was published, which
    identifies new safeguarding roles and responsibilities without any
    commitment to increased staffing and resources. Multiple stakeholders have expressed concerns about both the viability of this and the overall policy
direction the HSE is taking in adult safeguarding.

32.  The National Independent Review Panel established by the HSE, reviews
    cases related to serious failings by the HSE and/or its funded organisations.
    In the case of the ‘Brandon’ report, the National Independent Review Panel
    advised that HSE management disregarded the advice and expertise of the
    Safeguarding and Protection social work team in terms of how serious
    safeguarding concerns should be dealt with. This was despite the
    establishment of a HSE National Safeguarding Office, the introduction of a
    national safeguarding policy and advice from an expert social work team.
33.  When safeguarding policy was established, the process did not require direct
    social work involvement in the assessment of concerns about abuse
    anymore, and instead, social workers on the safeguarding teams had
    oversight of what the service was doing to protect people. This meant that
    HSE-funded section 38 and 39 services are meant to safeguard the residents
    of their services and let the safeguarding team know what they do. These
    services report the concern and are also responsible for safeguarding.
34.  The Department of Health is developing a national adult safeguarding policy
    for the entire health sector, together with accompanying legislation however
    no interim measures have been taken to address risks in safeguarding
    practices and systems.
35.  Failure to report and follow up in the ‘Brandon’ case where the abuse of
    adults with disabilities repeatedly occurred over decades, and was known to
    HSE staff and management, demonstrates the clear need for new and
    effective legislation to mandate staff to report abuse of adults in residential
    services and in certain other circumstances. When there are serious concerns
    of abuse, the lack of appropriate legal mechanisms to support social work
    access to the adult at risk of abuse, in cases when access may be denied by service providers (i.e., private residential services) or individuals (i.e., private
dwellings).

36.  There was appropriate outrage, and a redress scheme was set up in response
    to children harmed in the CAMHS failure in Kerry, but no such scheme has
    been proposed for residents who were repeatedly sexually assaulted in the
    ‘Brandon’ case. Shortly after the ‘Brandon’ report, another serious
    safeguarding failure in emerged, causing HIQA to question the HSE’s ability
    to provide safe services for people with disabilities.
37.  There is no national social work strategy in Ireland and no plan for how
    Government policies will be implemented and delivered where they depend
    on social workers. There is also no social work strategy or a social work
    workforce plan at a national level.
38.  Social work faces very challenges in influencing the governance and
management of adult safeguarding and practice through the human rights
lens and approach, as the medicalised model is encountered at strategic and
practice level as that described by people with disabilities, which does not
adequately address their needs.

### Inconsistencies and resourcing issues across CHOs

39. Current Safeguarding policies are limited, resulting in inconsistent
    approaches across sectors and organisations, and gaps in responses from
    State Agencies and other parties to adequately safeguard the person at risk
    of abuse.
40. Each CHO has a Safeguarding and Protection Social Work team, led by a
    Principal Social Worker who reports to a Head of Quality, Safety and Service
    Improvement, who in turn reports to the most senior manager in each CHO,
    the Chief Officer. Due to several challenges, including critical under-
    resourcing, safeguarding referrals are responded to in different ways by each
    safeguarding and protection social work team. There has been consistent under-resourcing of social workers and designated officers at local service
level, even when there is a high-profile case or crisis in an individual HSE CHO
area/local service.

41.  There are also concerning variations in the type and quality of adult
    safeguarding reviews commissioned by organisations when failures arise.
42.  There is a need for developed systems and efficiencies within the HSE
    regarding adult safeguarding. Some safeguarding teams go into private
    nursing homes and others do not, the same for acute hospitals. There are
    also gaps in dealing with self-neglect and other issues.
43.  The HSE plans to introduce new safeguarding roles (alongside existing social
    work safeguarding posts) solely for the nursing profession. However, this is a
    concerning extension of the existing medicalised approach and ignores the
    central message of the ‘Brandon’ report, which is to move away from viewing
    safeguarding through a clinical, medicalised lens and instead operate from a
    rights-based model with a broad range of professional expertise and
    perspectives. Given the size of the nursing workforce already present in both
    strategic management and frontline practice posts, the HSE should include
    additional and holistic perspectives in the safeguarding of their systems, to
    avoid dominance of any one clinical or professional paradigm.

### Awareness raising, lack of human dignity and will and preference.

44. The lack of statutory right to home care, along with the staffing crisis in
    privatised home care sector, means people with disabilities are being
    prematurely admitted to nursing homes, against their will and preferences,
    which is a deprivation of liberty. People with disabilities who use
    safeguarding services are often viewed solely as recipients of services, rather
    than rights holders, with their own wishes and preferences. The HSE has not
    commissioned any research to understand the preferences of people who
    use safeguarding services. This means the voices of adults at risk are absent, giving imbalanced weight to the views of professionals and paid advocates. More research has been funded into the experience of care staff, rather than
residents of care settings over the time of Covid.
 
45.  Of most importance, residents are often denied information about their own
    care setting and their voices are often absent or marginal in discussions
    about monitoring of the system in which they are the most important
    stakeholder. The quality of sex and sexuality education in congregated
    settings is unknown. Understanding about and approaches to the
    management in residential services of those who have committed sexual
    offences is variable across settings.
46.  Where a person lacks decision-making capacity, this is used as an excuse not
    to pursue issues that arise in relation to his or her rights. If a person has
    dementia or has an intellectual disability then rather than, as the Act
    provides, there being a clear presumption of capacity, straight away people
    revert to an assumption that the person lacks capacity. A significant cultural
    shift is required.

### Urgent need for independent advocacy

47. Independent advocacy is an important resource for individuals at risk of
    abuse, yet statutory advocacy support, on an independent basis, despite
    being available in other jurisdictions, is not within Ireland’s safeguarding
    responses. Independent advocacy is important process in supporting people
    to make and communicate decisions and to participate in decisions about
    their lives, such as access to finances, accessing services, planning ahead,
    support when there is desire to move residence, issues relating to abuse or
    neglect and barriers to decision-making.
48. While thousands of adults receive care at home, with family members acting
    as a principal carer, more still receive care in a variety of residential care
    settings. It must be acknowledged that though many care-givers discharge their responsibilities conscientiously and to the best of their abilities, this
does not guarantee that the rights, will and preference of the individual are
front and centre.
 
49.  There is a need to ensure that individuals living in settings where there may
    be a risk of safeguarding concerns have access to advocacy support.
    Advocacy is especially important regarding making and communicating
    decisions when there is desire to move out of a congregated setting.
50.  Where a person’s liberty is being restricted, they should have access to an
    independent advocate to ensure their will and preference is heard. If a
    person who has been in a system of care where other people have been
    making decisions, and that is the only thing the person is familiar with, is
    offered a choice to move out, it may not be comprehensively understood. It
    may be necessary to pilot options until the best solution is identified by the
    individual. The individual needs to know he or she has equal rights, that he or
    she is not beholden to somebody else and that there are organisations that
    are independent and can help.
51.  The Committee heard how there is a need to ensure roll out of appropriate
    training using a whole of organisation approach on adult safeguarding across
    care settings including all levels of staff because it may be the porter, the
    cleaner or even the visitors coming in who see something and can raise a
    concern.

### People in congregated settings are disproportionately impacted.

52. Residents who live in congregated or campus-based settings often
    experience significant safeguarding issues, inequalities in the quality and
    safety of their services, control over their own lives and the ability to exercise
    their rights and choices independently. These types of residential settings in
    tandem with providing people with no choice, are sustaining safeguarding
    issues.

53. Residents can abuse other residents, but there is also sustained
    organisational abuse where the provider has failed to adequately protect
    residents and meet their needs. While this situation can occur in any setting,
    there is a higher risk of organisational abuse in congregated settings than in
    community-based houses.
54. These residents may not wish to live together or are living in large groups,
    sometimes in overcrowded environments and this can lead individuals to
    express their distress and unhappiness behaviourally. It has also, on
    occasion, led to residents hurting and harming themselves or their fellow
    residents, sometimes on an ongoing basis, including residents living in fear of
    their peers. This is not acceptable and has been a major challenge for the
    disability sector.
55. At the Committee’s public meeting – 9 February 2023 ‘Awareness raising –
    congregated settings’, Paul Alford spoke about his experience in a
    congregated setting and what it was like to live in these types of settings and
    how his freedom, dignities and rights were impacted along with a lack of
    support to become more independent. Sometimes Paul lived in dormitories
    with other people with disabilities, with no choice over what to eat and what
    time to get up and had to get permission any time he wanted to leave. Paul
    was supported to move from these settings to live independently in the
    community which greatly improved his quality of life.
56. Paul told the Committee that ‘we need more people out of these institutions
    and leading a good life with their own support and choice with who they want
    to live with’. Paul also told the Committee that ‘the Government need to
    listen to people in these settings and what they want. It’s our choices and our
    voices at the end of the day’.

57. While there has been a continued effort within the disability sector to reduce
    the number of large, congregated settings, many residents continue to be
    accommodated in these living arrangements.
58. Individuals with significant behavioural presentations when they were living
    in congregated settings, had a positive experience when moved to
    community-based services and the intensity and frequency of those
    behavioural presentations significantly reduced.

### Deprivation of liberty legislation that balances protection with autonomy.

59. A deprivation of liberty is defined as an oppressive restriction by a third
    party’ and people are de facto detained if they are in residential care and the
    building is secured, requiring residents to ask permission to leave the
    premises.
60. Individuals who are residing in a care setting may not have made the choice
    to do so but are there due to a lack of a statutory right to homecare, a lack of
    flexible models of care to meet individual’s needs, and lack of adequate
    homecare service provision. At present, unfortunately, there is a one-way
    system within nursing homes which limits the possibility of going out back
    into the community.
61. There is a disproportionate deprivation of liberty for people with mental
    illness. Irelands involuntary admission rate is positive but low admissions
    come at a price, resulting in people with mental illness in prison, homeless or
    at home and too ill to accept treatment but not ill enough for treatment
    without consent.
62. There is specific legislation for people who commit crime; they have a right
    to a fair trial and to legal representation. There is detailed mental health
    legislation for people who are involuntary detained. However, there is no
    detailed legislation covering people who are put into places of care or into congregated settings where they do not want to be. There is a need to ensure
their individual rights, their will, and their preference are respected. The
deprivation of liberty is a constitutional matter under the Assisted Decision-
Making (Capacity) Act 2015. However, there is no process prescribed by law
as is required by the Constitution, the European Convention on Human
Rights, and the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

63.  A change is required to Coercive Control legislation to relate it to people in
    non-intimate relationships.
64.  The Committee noted the importance of the enactment of Deprivation of
    Liberty legislation which should also consider expanding coercive control
    outside restrictive scope of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 in dealing with
    coercive control Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023;
    revising and progressing the Mental Health Act, 2001 and safeguarding
    provision in police and community legislation and a need for the collection of
    data.

### Monitoring Legislative and regulatory provision

65. An adequate legislative foundation is crucial if Ireland is to have a fit-for-
    purpose safeguarding capability, to address the gaps and deficits, and ensure
    compliance with Article 16 of UNCRPD.
66. Legal protection from abuse, neglect and exploitation decreases for every
    person, including a person with disability, when they turn 18 in Ireland.
67. There is urgent need to develop the regulatory and legislative infrastructure
    to safeguard people with disabilities in Ireland and protect against harm
    while supporting higher quality of life outcomes for individuals who may be
    vulnerable across all settings, create the conditions of possibility for
    prevention, early intervention, and ongoing comprehensive management of
    cases of safeguarding adults. Safeguarding legislation should ensure:

    a) reflection of deprivation of liberty arrangements
       
    b) reflection of Health Act 2007 and associated regulations
       
    c) placing the wishes and preferences, including right to live
independently of adults at the heart of safeguarding in line with the
underpinning principles of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity)
Act, 2015

    d) regulating Mandatory, Transparent, Safeguarding Adult Reviews
across all health and social care services carried out by suitably
qualified personnel.
        
    e) a broader definition of a designated centre that takes a more
holistic view of the supports people with disabilities require,
providing greater protection and enhancing their quality of life.

    f) a right of entry if there is suspicion of abuse happening within a
home or any environment and a right of assessment of that person
and to issue no-contact orders.

    g) the addressing of the limited form of protection afforded by
regulation of Nursing Homes

    h) appropriate legal mechanisms to support social workers to do their
work, and supporting social work access to adults at risk, used as a
last resort, when all reasonable efforts to establish access have
been denied by a third party.

    i) mandatory reporting of abuse and neglect of adults, including
provision for dealing with self-neglect

    j) a provision for statutory advocacy support on an independent basis
        
    k) that the activity of Safeguarding and Protection Social Work teams
are included in the monitoring by HIQA
 
68.  Placing adult safeguarding on a statutory footing acknowledges the State’s
    commitment to adults at risk, and the duty of civil society to adopt a zero-
    tolerance approach to adult abuse. In the absence of safeguarding legislation, HIQA uses the current regulatory framework to minimise risk for
people living in designated centres. However, ensuring that people with
disabilities are free from exploitation, violence and abuse can only be
achieved when all parties understand and exercise their responsibilities.
 
### Social model of safeguarding

69. It will take a collective effort across all relevant bodies and wider society to
    ensure appropriate safeguarding of people with disabilities.
70. Ireland is failing to safeguard mental health, freedom, autonomy, and social
    well-being as reflected in Articles 16 and 19 for people with severe mental
    illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Solutions including
    treating mental illness, safeguarding liberty, and safeguarding social and
    medical well-being in the community, systematic co-working between mental
    health services, primary care, and social care and individual health identifier
    numbers to connect services.
71. The Committee heard how there is a need to make sure that people know
    they have rights; where to go; who to access; that it is safe for them; and that
    making a report will not impact them. For example, if an individual reports
    that their caregiver is the person who is abusing, then the response should
    not be to put the individual into a nursing home or a congregated setting. The
    Committee acknowledge that there needs to be a cultural shift so that
    individuals are not afraid to report safeguarding issues for fear of being
    institutionalised or being deprived of their liberty.
72. There are difficulties with the community services established to replace
    institutions however there is enormous opportunity within primary care as an
    existing structure, and in intellectual disability services. However, these
    services are mostly resourced to see people with moderate or severe
    intellectual disability who develop mental health problems, not people with
    mild intellectual disability who develop mental health problems.

73. There is a lack of awareness of the need to ensure person centred care as
    well as a lack of consistency with regard provision of person-centred care
    across care settings.
74. The State needs to, in tandem, enact appropriate safeguarding, as well as
    social care legislation to encompass all sectors.

### Urgent need for independent statutory body

75. The Committee heard detailed information on the proposal for a new
    statutory regulative authority. It should have at its core the overall goal of
    zero tolerance in our society of adult abuse, which will be emphasised
    through the four key pillars which Safeguarding Ireland highlight in their
    discussion paper, namely, prevention, protection, prosecution, and policy co-
    ordination. The Authority should have with responsibility for:

       a) receiving and investigating individual complaints across residential
          care settings, community services, and overseeing the investigation
          of complaints including where a person is not in receipt of any care
          services, as well as oversight of critical incidents including deaths
          and matters of abuse and neglect relating to adults at risk.

       b) carrying out statutory inspections of all relevant settings where
          vulnerable people are being cared for.

       c) relevant statutory bodies including the HSE, the Decision Support
          Service, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission would have a
          statutory obligation to report to the Authority on safeguarding
          issues.

       d) ensuring that Safeguarding and Protection Teams are independent
          of the HSE.

       e) responsibility for ongoing awareness among professional and the
          public, particularly regarding supporting decision-making, empowering people with reduced capacity, using independent
advocacy, identifying risk and when and how to report concerns.

     f) reporting to a relevant Oireachtas Committee
